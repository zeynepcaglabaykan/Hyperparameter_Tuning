# Hyperparameter_Tuning
 
This project contains a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model developed with the use of data obtained from a Portuguese bank to predict whether customers will deposit money or not.
## Data Set

The dataset used in the project includes attributes such as age, occupation, marital status, whether they have taken out a home loan, the time elapsed since the last contact, and whether the contact was made via a landline or a mobile phone for 11,000 individuals.
