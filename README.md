# Hyperparameter_Tuning
 
This project contains a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model developed with the use of data obtained from a Portuguese bank to predict whether customers will deposit money or not.
Our primary objective was to develop a predictive model to determine whether these individuals would invest in the bank's deposit services. To achieve this, we utilized the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, and we conducted hyperparameter-tuning using the Grid Search algorithm. This project represents effort to harness machine learning techniques for the purpose of improving decision-making within the banking sector.
### Data Set

The dataset used in the project includes attributes such as age, occupation, marital status, whether they have taken out a home loan, the time elapsed since the last contact, and whether the contact was made via a landline or a mobile phone for 11,000 individuals.
